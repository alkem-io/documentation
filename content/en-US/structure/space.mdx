# Understanding the Space

## What is a Space?

A **Space** is a virtual environment for collaboration. It serves as a hub for a community that shares a common interest, project, or initiative. Each Space provides structured tools for working together, exchanging ideas, and driving collective progress.

### Key Features of a Space

- A Dashboard that provides an overview of activities, updates, and key information. You can see here who is the lead and the host (organisation) of the Space. More information about these roles can be found in the Community section of the [Create a Space page](/getting-started/create-space) of the documentation.
- A Community section to see which **Contributors** and **Virtual Contributors** are members of the Space.
- A Subspaces tab where smaller, more focused working groups can collaborate. More information about Subspaces can be found on the [Subspace page](/subspace).
- A Knowledge Base to store and share relevant resources.

[Check out the Welcome Space as an example](https://alkem.io/welcome-space/dashboard).

### Space Toolbar

At the top right of your Space, you will find two or three icons that provide additional functionality:

- The **Activity Log** (clock with arrow) shows a pop-up window with history of recent actions, including posts, member additions, and updates.
- The **Videocall** (camera icon) lets you start or join a video call that all visitors of the Space can access. Read more about this functionality [here](/features/videocall).
- The **Share button** (connected dots) allows you to easily share the Space with others. If the Space is private, invitations may require admin approval.
- The Settings button (gear icon) is visible only to admins and allows them to configure the Space. F.e. the visibility can be changed here, or membership permissions and roles. More information about configuring the Space can be found in the [Create a Space Page](/getting-started/create-space).

### Who Can Create a Space?

A **Space** can be created by a member of the platform with the rights to do so, or with the help of the Alkemio team. 

### What Value Can I Get from a Space Community?

Joining or creating a Space allows you to drive meaningful collaboration on projects, challenges, or innovations.
A well-structured Space fosters engagement, sparks discussions, and facilitates progress. Whether you are contributing to an existing initiative or launching your own, Spaces are the foundation of collaboration within Alkemio.
