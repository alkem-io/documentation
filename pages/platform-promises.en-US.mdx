## Introduction

In this section, we share our core principles and promises for the hosted version of [Alkemio](https://alkem.io/). 
If you have any questions or would like further information, please contact the team. 

## Principles

[Alkemio](https://www.alkem.io) believes that digitalization should bring society together. Supporting and enabling our cooperation. This implies a fundamentally different approach.

<details>
  <summary>You are not the product</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We don’t sell your data. Our business runs on subscriptions, not ads or data sales. The free version is truly free—no tricks, no hidden data collection. We offer a free version to support our community. You are not paying with your data.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Your Space, your control</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Alkemio makes it possible to access all data you have access to in a re-usable format.
        You can download the data in your Space anytime or migrate it to another application (such as a spreadsheet). If you wish to do so, contact the team, we’re happy to help.
        Unlike other social media, we won’t lock you in.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Open source & transparent</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We build our platform in the open. Our code is available under an EU-approved open-source license ([EU-PL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Public_Licence)).
    This means anyone can check how things work, ensuring fairness and security. Or even contribute to the project!
    You can find our GitHub [here](https://github.com/alkem-io).</p>
    <p>Being open source means all of our algorithms are transparent so they can be audited and verified.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Control of Alkemio is not for sale</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Alkemio uses steward-ownership to ensure decisions are made in the best interest of our purpose.
Any changes must be carefully considered by the stewards and an independent third party, rather than by shareholders.
Read more about our legal structure [here](https://www.alkemio.org/structure/).</p>
  </div>
</details>

## Compliance

<details>
  <summary>Data protection</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We follow the European GDPR rules, which are some of the strongest privacy laws in the world.
While we comply with these minimum requirements, we also adhere to stricter privacy laws if required by other jurisdictions, ensuring your data is always protected.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Privacy Policy</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Our Privacy Policy explains exactly how we handle your data.
You can find our policy [here](https://welcome.alkem.io/privacy/).</p>
  </div>
</details>

## Hosting

<details>
  <summary>Your data stays in Europe</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Alkemio uses infrastructure from Scaleway, our trusted hosting provider that is headquartered in the EU.
The Scaleway data center that Alkemio uses is in The Netherlands.
These centers follow the highest safety standards, and your data is protected under European laws.
Have a look at Scaleway’s website to learn more about their strong certifications [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/security-and-resilience/).</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Third-party services</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The above applies to our core platform data.
However, for third-party processors or sub processors, it may vary.
You can find a list of them [here](https://welcome.alkem.io/third-parties/).</p>
  </div>
</details>

## Back-ups & Data Retention

<details>
  <summary>Regular backups for protection</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We back up all platform data every four hours to reduce the risk of data loss.
We then also make an additional daily backup, so your content stays safe even if something unexpected happens.
Finally, back-ups are stored in a separate geographic location (within Europe) then the operating system.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Space content retention</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>If the subscription for a Space expires, or a Space is made inactive, the data remains accessible for two years.
You can download it or reactivate your account at any point during this period.
If you wish so, you can also delete your content directly.</p>
  </div>
</details>

## Monitoring

<details>
  <summary>Analytics to improve the platform</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We track how the platform is used, such as which features are popular and where activity is.
This helps us improve the platform and fix issues.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Error tracking and support</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We track reported errors, so we can actively solve any issues you as a user may experience and improve the platform.</p>
  </div>
</details>

## Security

<details>
  <summary>Security by design</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We have designed the Alkemio platform to be secure from the start.
Our team strives to follow best practices to keep your information safe and protect it from threats.
Examples include separating administration identities from normal working identities, fully separating production from development environments, ensuring production data is isolated from test data, layers of data backups, etc.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Strong authentication</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We support the usage of two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure you can protect your account.
In addition, if you already have a secure identity, Alkemio supports single sign-on (SSO) from selected providers.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Roles and responsibilities</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Alkemio supports clearly defined roles at both the platform level and within Spaces.
Key roles at the platform level include support, license management and platform administrators.
These roles separate our responsibilities, to ensure that platform security is maintained.
In addition, within each Space you can control what roles each user is assigned,
and also control access to Alkemio platform roles.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Information Security Policy</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Our information security policies for employees, contractors, and third parties are designed to safeguard our assets, ensure compliance, and align with best practices.
A full version of our policy is available upon request. </p>
  </div>
</details>

## Performance & Reliability

<details>
  <summary>Minimized disruption from updates</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We continuously improve the platform, working with our community to understand needs and support use cases.
We deploy many smaller releases rather than big releases to minimize disruption.
We strive to release outside of European work hours and keep downtime as short as possible.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Monitoring after every update</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>After each new release, we carefully watch for any issues and fix them as soon as possible.
We also share release updates in our forum, so you know what’s changed.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Performance optimized for Europe, Available Everywhere</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>All data is stored in European data centres.
The platform works worldwide, but also for data it takes time to travel.
So if you're far from Europe, it may be a little slower.</p>
  </div>
</details>

## Accessibility

<details>
  <summary>We strive to support WCAG level A </summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>In 2023, we conducted an initial evaluation in collaboration with our partners and implemented our first improvements
You can learn more about this in [our blog post](https://welcome.alkem.io/blog/2024-03-accessibility/).
We recognize that accessibility is an ongoing effort and welcome collaboration to continue enhancing our platform.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Designed for Desktop, Friendly on Mobile</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Alkemio is best used on desktop, but we do ensure that the platform is mobile friendly.</p>
  </div>
</details>

## Future Improvements

<details>
  <summary>Certifications</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We have not yet initiated the certification processes for ISO 27001 and SOC2
We are aware of the importance for certain use cases
If this is the case for you, please reach out.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Contributions</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Since our code is open-source, anyone can suggest improvements or help build new features. You can find our GitHub [here](https://github.com/alkem-io).</p>
