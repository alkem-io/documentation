# Complete your Profile

Great to have you on board of the Alkemio platform! When you created an account, you were asked to fill out some basic details, but there is more you can fill in your personal profile! Here is how you can do that:

## Navigation

![My Profile](/My-Profile-Menu.png)

Navigate to your profile, by clicking your avatar in the top right corner of the screen. In the drop-down menu that appears, click on “My Profile”.
To change your personal details, click on the gear icon to the right of your name. This brings you to the page where you can update your personal details. The more complete your profile, the easier it is for other people to find you and to understand what you can contribute in a (sub)space.

### Example

![Example Profile](/profile-example.png)
As an employee at Alkemio, I will fill out my name, demographics, jobtitle in the tagline and some information about what I do, how I got here and what my interests are in the Bio. I also fill in some skills like Open Source, GitHub, Community Management and Customer Success in the Skills field, so people can quickly see my fields of expertise. I fill out my interests and values, like GreenTech and Sustainability in the Keywords section.
I will also add the link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub page and my X profile when I have those.
