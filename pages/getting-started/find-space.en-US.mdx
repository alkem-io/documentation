# Find a Space on Alkemio

Spaces are the core of activity on the Alkemio platform. Each Space represents a specific topic, project, or initiative where people collaborate, share ideas, and take action. Exploring and joining the right Space is key to getting the most out of Alkemio.

## How to Explore Spaces
