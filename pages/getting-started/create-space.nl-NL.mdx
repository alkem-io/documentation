# Create a Space

Maybe there already is a Space wanting to create the same impact that you want to make! Have a look [here](https://alkem.io/spaces) to see if that is the case.
Join that space and help accelerate it!

If that's not the case, create your own and start making impact!

Depending on your rights, you may be able to create a Space on your own, or will need the Alkemio team to set one up for you.

## Navigation: Create it on your own

Go to your account page of on your profile by

- Click on your profile picture on the top right corner of the screen
- Click on MY Profile
- Click on the gear icon right of your name
- Go to the ACCOUNT tab
- Click the + icon in the Hosted Spaces box
- Fill out the details of the Space

## Setting Up Your Space

If you are unable to create a Space yourself, ask for the Alkemio team's support.

After the Alkemio team has set it up for you, you can customize it yourself. Navigate to the General Settings of the Space. To do that, head to your Space, then hit the cog icon next to the other tabs. Now click on the **Settings** sub-section.

Here you can decide on:

- **Visibility** of your Space (public or private)
- **Who can join** your Space (any user, only invited users, or users associated with certain organizations)
- **Permissions** for Space members (what they can do)
- **Application Form Questions** (select a few questions for the application form)

Now letâ€™s have a look at the other sub-sections: **Profile**, **Context**, **Community**, **Updates**, **Subspaces**, **Templates**, and **Storage**.

#### Space Profile

To make your Space visually attractive for new members, it is important to choose an engaging **tagline** as well as **visuals**. They will be visible on the home page for all visitors of the platform as well as the dashboard page of your Space.

Also, you can add additional **tags** to summarize the content and make the Space easier to find. Finally, you can add **references** (links and documents) for your community, such as:

- Your website or the facilitating organization
- An article or report related to this Space
- An introduction video, etc.

#### Context

For yourself and the members of your community, it is essential to understand the **context** of the Space. We have divided this into four key sections:

- **Vision**
- **Background**
- **Impact**
- **Who Should Be Involved**

The provided questions will guide you through filling in all these sections. Note that you can also use text styles such as **bold**, **headings**, etc., or add **images** to make it more visually attractive and understandable. Start with a first pass; it is always adjustable later.

#### Community

Here you can manage:

- **Pending Applications and Invitations**
- **Community Roles** of members and leading users and organizations

There are four different types of community roles for users and organizations:

1. **Members**: Contribute to the Space with insights and experiences.
2. **Leads**: Visible as and responsible for driving the activity in this Space.
3. **Admins**: Not visible as leads but can manage the content of the Space in the backend.
4. **Host**: Responsible for the content of the Space, such as moderating undesired content or discussions. This role is visible on the profile of the Space and can be managed by the Alkemio Team.

#### Updates, Subspaces, and Storage

These sections are straightforward as they allow you to:

- **Post Updates**
- **Manage Subspaces**
- **Access Documents** uploaded in your Space

If you already have a few ideas in mind regarding Subspaces for this community, you can directly add them under the **Subspaces** tab. Our **context questions** will guide you through the process of framing your Subspace. Note that for Subspaces, you can follow similar steps as the ones for the Space to further populate it.

#### Templates

This section allows you to decide what **templates** you want to make available for the community. These templates can be used by members when:

- Working with the collaboration tools
- Starting a new Subspace
