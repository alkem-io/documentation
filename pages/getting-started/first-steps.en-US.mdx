## Introduction: Why Alkemio?

Using the Alkemio platform, organizations that work with individuals from other organizations can create and group the whole community around a certain theme or project and share knowledge.

For example, to avoid having different WhatsApp or Signal groups with individuals from one organization and another group with people from another organization. In the end, you need to connect to both organizations/groups on the same issue. Using Alkemio is a way of sparing time, being more effective, and successfully solving the issue altogether as a community.

## What Value Can I Get from the Alkemio Community?

Alkemio is the platform launched to reveal the infinite potential of collaboration between **organizations, individual users, partners, businesses, researchers, and citizens**. Public values should be central to achieving systematic change in how we work together on challenges and projects.

While tools like Teams, Slack, Google Workspace, WhatsApp, and Signal are great for interacting and managing your project, they do not put the challenge or change at the center. Having a clear shared understanding of the change is critical. [Read more about this in our blog post about community building here.](#)
