- Leverage the power of AI using Virtual Contributors - instant & 24/7 contribution.

- Network effect - finding others with shared interests and new expertise.

- Backed by Alkemio Foundation, designed to benefit society.

### How does it work?

In your Alkemio Space, you can set up a collaboration project, train your own Virtual Contributor, and invite everyone to join you.

Get your own Space and bring your network in. Work with your community and with AI Virtual Contributors. Personalize your space with digital whiteboards, tailored workflows, posts, and other useful collaboration tools.
