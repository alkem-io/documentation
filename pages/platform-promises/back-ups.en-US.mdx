## Back-ups & Data Retention

### Regular backups for protection

We back up all platform data every four hours to reduce the risk of data loss.
We then also make an additional daily backup, so your content stays safe even if something unexpected happens.
Finally, back-ups are stored in a separate geographic location (within Europe) then the operating system.

### Space content retention

If the subscription for a Space expires, or a Space is made inactive, the data remains accessible for two years.
You can download it or reactivate your account at any point during this period.
If you wish so, you can also delete your content directly.
