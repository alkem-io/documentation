## Future Improvements 

### Certifications  
We have not yet initiated the certification processes for ISO 27001 and SOC2
We are aware of the importance for certain use cases
If this is the case for you, please reach out.

### Contributions 

Since our code is open-source, anyone can suggest improvements or help build new features. You can find our GitHub [here](https://github.com/alkem-io).
