## Principles

[Alkemio](https://www.alkem.io) believes that digitalization should bring society together. Supporting and enabling our cooperation. This implies a fundamentally different approach.

### You are not the product

We don’t sell your data. Our business runs on subscriptions, not ads or data sales. The free version is truly free—no tricks, no hidden data collection. We offer a free version to support our community. You are not paying with your data.

### Your Space, your control

Alkemio makes it possible to access all data you have access to in a re-usable format.  
You can download the data in your Space anytime or migrate it to another application (such as a spreadsheet). If you wish to do so, contact the team, we’re happy to help.  
Unlike other social media, we won’t lock you in.

### Open source & transparent

We build our platform in the open. Our code is available under an EU-approved open-source license ([EU-PL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Public_Licence)).  
This means anyone can check how things work, ensuring fairness and security. Or even contribute to the project!  
You can find our GitHub [here](https://github.com/alkem-io).

Being open source means all of our algorithms are transparent so they can be audited and verified.

### Control of Alkemio is not for sale

Alkemio uses steward-ownership to ensure decisions are made in the best interest of our purpose.  
Any changes must be carefully considered by the stewards and an independent third party, rather than by shareholders.
