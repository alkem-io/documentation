## Security

### Security by design

We have designed the Alkemio platform to be secure from the start.
Our team strives to follow best practices to keep your information safe and protect it from threats.
Examples include separating administration identities from normal working identities, fully separating production from development environments, ensuring production data is isolated from test data, layers of data backups, etc.

### Strong authentication

We support the usage of two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure you can protect your account.
In addition, if you already have a secure identity, Alkemio supports single sign-on (SSO) from selected providers.

### Roles and responsibilities

Alkemio supports clearly defined roles at both the platform level and within Spaces.
Key roles at the platform level include support, license management and platform administrators.
These roles separate our responsibilities, to ensure that platform security is maintained.
In addition, within each Space you can control what roles each user is assigned,
and also control access to Alkemio platform roles. 

### Information Security Policy 

Our information security policies for employees, contractors, and third parties are designed to safeguard our assets, ensure compliance, and align with best practices.
