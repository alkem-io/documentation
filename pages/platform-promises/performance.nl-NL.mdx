## Performance and Reliability

### Deze sectie wordt binnenkort naar het Nederlands vertaald. Minimized disruption from updates

We continuously improve the platform, working with our community to understand needs and support use cases.
We deploy many smaller releases rather than big releases to minimize disruption.
We strive to release outside of European work hours and keep downtime as short as possible.

### Monitoring after every update

After each new release, we carefully watch for any issues and fix them as soon as possible.
We also share release updates in our forum, so you know whatâ€™s changed.

### Performance optimized for Europe, Available Everywhere

All data is stored in European data centres.
The platform works worldwide, but also for data it takes time to travel.
So if you're far from Europe, it may be a little slower.
