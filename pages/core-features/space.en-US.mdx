# Platform Key Concepts

In this section, you will find the key concepts representing the hierarchy of the Alkemio platform, along with explanations of their functions and utility.

What do we mean by words such as **“Space”**, **“Subspace”**, and **“Collaboration Tool”**? We explain this below.

## Understanding the Space

### What is a Space?

Picture a **Space** as a virtual environment created for you to engage with something you care about and want to find solutions for. It is a community with a specific frame of reference, under the responsibility of the lead user or organization. The key goal is to gather people and organize them into Subspaces.

### Who Can Create a Space?

A **Space** can be created by members of the platform, together with us, based on a general topic that the creator is interested in. You can start a Space to gather further ideas or simply see it as a place to raise awareness about an issue you believe is urgent and relatable to others. [A demo of an example Space can be found here.](#)

### What Value Can I Get from a Space Community?

Through a **Space**, you can raise attention to a topic of your interest and find more people who share your same interest but have different visions. It is important to create Spaces because they allow topics of interest that concern different people to inspire more ideas. This leads to the creation of different communities around meaningful topics that are relevant to many. Creating a Space means generating knowledge on relevant areas that can then be divided into specific Subspaces—a step that brings us to the next key concept of our platform.
