## Before You Onboard Your Community

Keep these tips in mind to set your community up for success:

- **Ownership**: Identify a facilitator to design and guide the structure, and a community manager to handle membership, updates, and engagement. Also, assign leads for the Subspaces to ensure they receive focused attention.
- **Timelines**: Establish clear timelines or phases for your project or initiative. This helps members understand their objectives and expectations, driving engagement.
- **Champions**: Select champions who are familiar with the platform to guide and inspire others. Their enthusiasm and knowledge will motivate members to embrace the platform.
- **Keep it simple**: Avoid overwhelming your community. Start small and clearly explain what they’ll gain from using the platform, why it’s valuable, and when it should (or shouldn’t) be used.

## While Onboarding and Activating Your Community

Start by engaging your champions, ensuring they actively contribute to populating the Space with relevant content and demonstrating various ways to utilize the platform effectively. Together you want to highlight the potential benefits the platform brings to the community. Then, gradually onboard the rest of the members by familiarizing them with the setup and the overarching goals. Our team can help you with providing these trainings.

To keep members engaged, guide them back to the platform regularly through strategies such as:

- **Combination of online and offline**: Use the platform during meetings to capture results, share feedback, and assign tasks. This integration helps members become comfortable with the platform's functionality.
- **Newsletters**: Include small updates or highlights in your newsletter to direct members to detailed content or use cases in the Space.
- **Tagging and content sharing**: Tag members in posts or encourage them to share content they’ve shared elsewhere on the platform.

You can use the features mentioned under [Community Management](/features/community-management) to further activate your community. These features are designed to help you streamline processes, keep members engaged, and achieve your goals.
