# Managing Join Requests in Your Space

If your Space requires approval for new members, incoming requests will appear in the **Community** tab of your Space settings. 
As a Space admin, here's how you can review and approve them:

## How to Approve Join Requests

1. Navigate to your Space Settings.
2. Click on the **Community** tab in the top navigation bar.
3. Go to **Pending applications & invitations**.
4. You will see a list of applicants. Click the **eye icon** (`üëÅ`) next to the person you'd like to review.
5. A detail screen will appear, allowing you to **approve or reject** the request.

Once approved, the user will become a member of your Space with the **USER** role.

## Additional Notes

- Approved members will **not receive a separate confirmation email**, so it's good practice to welcome them via a post or message.
- You can only manage join requests if you are a Space admin
