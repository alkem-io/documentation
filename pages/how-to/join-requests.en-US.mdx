# Managing Join Requests in Your Space

If your Space requires approval for new members, incoming requests will appear in the **Community** tab of your Space settings. 
As a Space admin, here's how you can review and approve them:

## How to Approve Join Requests

1. Navigate to your Space Settings.
2. Click on the **Community** tab in the top navigation bar.
3. Go to **Pending applications & invitations**.
4. You will see a list of applicants. Click the **eye icon** (`üëÅ`) next to the person you'd like to review to see their application form.
5. Click the checkmark icon or cross icon to approve or reject the application.

Once approved, the user will become a member of your Space with the **USER** role.

Note: You can only manage join requests if you are a Space admin
