## Understanding the Collaboration Tool

### What is a Collaboration Tool?

**Collaboration Tools** are essentially potential questions people may want to raise after starting to work in a **Space** or a **Subspace**. Collaboration Tools should be created to clarify concepts and answer possible questions the community may have. They are a way to involve the community and get feedback on how the overall Space is progressing.

### Why Create Collaboration Tools?

Collaboration Tools help in:
- **Clarifying Concepts**: Making sure everyone has a clear understanding of the project's goals and methodologies.
- **Engaging the Community**: Encouraging active participation and feedback from community members.
- **Tracking Progress**: Monitoring how the Space or Subspace is evolving and addressing any emerging challenges promptly.

### What Can You Do by Creating Collaboration Tools?

By creating Collaboration Tools, you can:
- **Facilitate Communication**: Ensure smooth and effective communication among community members.
- **Enhance Problem-Solving**: Provide structured ways to address and solve issues collaboratively.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Streamline the workflow and make the collaborative process more efficient.
