# Events

Events in Alkemio provide a **structured way to manage and communicate key activities**, ensuring that community members stay informed and engaged. They help facilitate collaboration, planning, and coordination by keeping track of **scheduled meetings**, **important milestones**, and **interactive sessions**.

Events are displayed in the **Events block** within a Space or Subspace. Members can see all upcoming events relevant to their Space.

If enabled by an admin, events from Subspaces can also appear in the parent Space, allowing for a broader view of all scheduled activities across different levels of collaboration.

Members can choose how they view events:

- **List View**: A simple overview of upcoming events.
- **Calendar View**: A structured visual layout of events in a monthly format.
  This a personal setting, meaning each member can choose which view to enable.

## Adding Events

Only **admins** can create and manage events. To add an event:

1. Click the "+" button in the Events block.

- **Title** and **Event Type** (Event, Training, Milestone, Other).

## Managing Events from Subspaces

Admins can configure whether events from Subspaces should appear in the main Space calendar. This setting can be found in the "Allowed Actions" block of the Settings tab in the Space settings.

- If enabled, **all Subspace events will be visible** in the parent Space.
- If disabled, events **remain within their respective Subspaces** and are not shown in the main Space.

This setting provides flexibility in how events are managed across different levels of a Space.
