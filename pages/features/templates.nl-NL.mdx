# Templates

Innovation is not always easy, and at **Alkemio**, we want to make it easier for everyone to innovate effectively. 
**Templates** in Alkemio provide a structured way to set up different elements within a Space or Subspace. They help streamline **collaboration**, **standardize processes**, and **guide community engagement**. Instead of starting from scratch, templates allow users to quickly apply best practices when creating:

- **Community Guidelines**
- **Subspaces**
- **Collaboration Tools** (Posts, Whiteboards, Collection of Links and Documents, Call for Whiteboards and Call for Posts)

Using templates ensures consistency, saves time, and makes it easier for members to navigate and contribute effectively.

## Space Library

Every Space has its own Template Library, where admins can manage templates specifically for that Space.

What Can You Do in the Space Template Library?

- Add Templates from the General Library – Import existing templates from the platform-wide General Library to use in your Space.
- Create New Templates – Develop custom templates tailored to the needs of your Space and its community.

## Template Library

The **Template Library** on Alkemio makes it easier to share best practices for effective innovation. The Template Library is a collection of **whiteboard templates**, **guided innovation flows**, and **exercises** to do with your community. They offer guidance and structure to users of the platform. This results in alignment between all parties and an overview of the steps needed to make change. Our Best Practices library is growing daily, with new templates from multiple parties that can share knowledge and expertise.

The library is divided into two sections:

1. **Templates Bundled into Template Packs**
   - **Template Packs** are a coherent set of templates based on, for example, a specific theory or theme, best practices shared by an organization, or recommended by a knowledge institute.
   - Clicking on a **Template Pack** allows you to see:
     - The templates
     - The facilitating organization
     - A description and references
   - **Anyone** can share their templates in this library to support innovation. If you are interested, please reach out via the **[forum](https://alkem.io/forum)** or by sending an email to **info@alkem.io**.

2. **Browse All Templates**
   Not sure which Template Pack contains the template you need? Simply browse all templates, **search by keywords**, or **filter based on template type**.

## How to Use Templates in Alkemio?

Templates can be applied when creating different elements within a Space or Subspace. Here’s how:

1. Using a template when creating Community Guidelines, a Subspace, or Collaboration Tool

- When setting up a Community Guideline, Subspace, or Collaboration Tool, look for the "FIND TEMPLATE" button.
  Clicking "FIND TEMPLATE" opens a selection of templates:
- This opens a selection of templates, organized as follows:
  - Space-specific templates (from the Space Template Library) appear first.
  - Templates from the General Library (platform-wide) appear below.
- Choose a template to pre-fill structured content.

2. Adding a Collaboration Tool from the Library

- When adding a Collaboration Tool, instead of selecting a specific tool directly, you can also choose:
  "...or have a look at the library."
- This opens the Template Library.
- Just like before, Space Templates appear first, followed by General Library templates.
- Select a template to create a new Collaboration Tool based on it.
