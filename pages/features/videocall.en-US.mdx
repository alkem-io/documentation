# Video call

Want to start a video call within your Space or Subspace on Alkemio?  
You can do that with **Jitsi**, the built-in video conferencing tool.

Jitsi allows you to directly collaborate with other participants from your Space without needing to install any additional software.
Read [here](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) more about Jitsi.


## What can you use Jitsi for?

With Jitsi you can:

- Start video calls within a Space or Subspace.  
- Collaborate and communicate in real-time with other participants.  
- Invite external participants via a link.  

## How to start a call?

1. **Go to your Space or Subspace**  
   Open the Space where you want to collaborate. Make sure video calling is enabled by the administrator.

2. **Click the video icon**  
   - In a **Space**, you'll find the button at the top right.  
   - In a **Subspace**, the button is located on the left side.  
   Each Space and Subspace has its own dedicated Jitsi room.

3. **Become the host**  
   The first person to open the call automatically becomes the *host*.  
   As host, you can adjust settings such as the lobby or the password.  
   > To become host, you need to sign in with a **Google or GitHub account**.

4. **Join the call**  
   Once the room is active, other participants can join the video call.


## Security

As the host, you can secure your Jitsi room in two ways.
Click the **three dots (⋯)** at the bottom right during the call and select **Security options**.

1. **Enable the lobby**  
   The lobby feature requires participants to request permission before entering the room. This prevents unwanted access.

2. **Set a password**  
   You can also add a password to the meeting.
   Share this password with people in your Space or Subspace, for example via a **post at the top of the (Sub)Space** with useful info or links.
   This way, all community members have quick access to the correct information.
   Be aware that a different password can be set each time a meeting room is opened.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> All security settings (like a password or lobby) **only apply during an active meeting**.
> Once the call ends and is started again, the host must **set these settings up again**.
> The Jitsi call link remains **the same** for a Space or Subspace — every (Sub)Space has a fixed meeting link.
> This means anyone with the link can always try to join when a new meeting starts, unless you reset the password or lobby.


### Sharing

- Participants from your Space or Subspace can open the call directly via the link in the (Sub)Space.  
- You can also copy and share the Jitsi call URL manually.  
- Keep in mind that video calls in public (Sub)Spaces are accessible to anyone who can visit the Space.  
- Shared links outside of Alkemio grant access to the meeting as long as it is active, unless a password or lobby is set.
