# iFrame

Do you want to share a video, a document or a form? You can do so by using an iFrame.

It is a powerful tool used to embed external content such as videos, documents, or interactive forms directly into a Post.

## What can you do with an iFrame?

Using an iFrame, you can:
- Embed videos from online platforms;
- Display documents or forms;
- Share interactive tools, widgets, or dashboards;
- Include other external content like maps, visualizations, or charts.

>Note: Only whitelisted sites can be embedded for security reasons. 
When your media source is not supported, you will not be able to embed the media. \

Please send an e-mail to support@alkem.io with information about the content source you would like to add.

## Example: Embed a video using an iFrame

Here's a step-by-step guide to embedding a video from an online platform into a Post using an iFrame:

1. **Go to the video**  
   Navigate to the video you want to embed (it needs to be available online).

2. **Click on "Share"**  
   Below or next to the video player, you'll find a **Share** button. Click on it to open sharing options.

3. **Select "Embed"**  
   In the sharing options, choose **Embed**. This will display a box containing the embed code for the video.

4. **Copy the Embed Code**  
   Highlight the code and copy it to your clipboard.

5. **Paste the Embed Code**  
   In your Post, choose the iFrame icon. Paste the embed code there. And that's it! The video is now available in your Post, and you can watch it from there.

The code is not always provided in the right format, sometimes you may need to change it, or create it yourself.
To help with that, here is an example embed code of one of our tutorials that we embed:

```html
<iframe

></iframe>
```
