# iFrame

Do you want to share a video, a document or a form? You can do so by using an iFrame.

It is a powerful tool used to embed external content such as videos, documents, or interactive forms directly into a collaboration tool.

## What can you do with an iFrame?

Using an iFrame, you can:
- Embed videos from online platforms;
- Display documents or forms;
- Share interactive tools, widgets, or dashboards;
- Include other external content like maps, visualizations, or charts.

## Example: Embed a video using an iFrame

Here's a step-by-step guide to embedding a video from an online platform into a collaboration tool using an iFrame:

1. **Go to the video**  
   Navigate to the video you want to embed (it needs to be available online).

2. **Click on "Share"**  
   Below or next to the video player, you'll find a **Share** button. Click on it to open sharing options.

3. **Select "Embed"**  
   In the sharing options, choose **Embed**. This will display a box containing the embed code for the video.

4. **Copy the Embed Code**  
   Highlight the code and copy it to your clipboard.

5. **Paste the Embed Code**  
   In your collaboration tool, choose the iFrame icon. Paste the embed code there. And that's it! The video is now available in your collaboration tool, and you can watch it from there.
