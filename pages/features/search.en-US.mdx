You can search the entire platform, or only the Space you are currently on.

## Key Uses

Search is designed to save users time and effort by making it easy to:
- **Discover Content**: Quickly find relevant projects, discussions, or documents. Insert a keyword and explore!
- **Navigate Spaces**: Efficiently locate information within Spaces you are part of or exploring. When you are in a Space or one of its Subspaces, you can decide to search within that Space only, or in the entire platform.
- **Retrieve Posts**: Have a specific Post in mind? You can search for those too.
- **Collaborate Effectively**: Identify collaboration opportunities by finding related topics or contributors.
