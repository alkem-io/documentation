# Community Management

Congratulations on starting to build your online community! Finding ways to keep your community engaged and active can be difficult. **Worry not**, you are not alone in this. Keep reading or join our **[Welcome Space](https://alkem.io/welcome-space/dashboard)**, where you can share insights and experiences from other leads as well as tips and tricks from the Alkemio team.

## Understand the Alkemio Structure

While you may be managing your projects using Excel spreadsheets, Trello to manage your tasks, Miro to capture your brainstorm sessions, or LinkedIn to find relevant people to connect with, the **Alkemio platform** combines it all— **for you to achieve collective action over your project or common goal**.

As for any tool, understanding the platform will help you get the most out of it. A good place to start is reading about the platform structure, namely **[Profile](/structure/profile)**, **[Space](/structure/space)**, **[Subspace](/structure/subspace)** and **[Custom Homepage](/structure/custom-homepage)**. Are you interested in reading more about the **mission and vision of the foundation** behind the platform? Have a look at our **[Manifesto](https://www.alkemio.org/manifesto/)**.

If you haven't yet, make sure to [set up your space first](/getting-started/create-space). Let's move on to community management as a feature.

## Activate the Community

You have rallied the community into one place. Now what?

Besides some descriptive information, it is key to engage and guide your community when they land on the platform. **Three key functionalities** that can help you with this are the following:

### Events

Bringing your community together in **on- or offline events** or meet-ups is key to activating them. Here you can add the upcoming events with:
- **Description**
- **Time and Location**
- **Link** to a meeting or sign-up page

### Recommendations

When you start working in your Space, there is a default section for **Recommendations by the Host**. This section can be used to guide your community to the most relevant content of the Space. Especially when they enter the Space for the first time, they want to know where to go. This collection of links can, for example, include:
- A **‘Getting Started in this Space’** document
- An **explainer video**
- **Questions** that most urgently need their action
- A **sign-up link** for the next community event

Of course, it is always possible to delete the section if you don’t want to use it.

### Collaboration Tools

Instead of only bringing the community together and starting discussions, the platform allows you to **really start collaborating together**. The platform offers a set of collaboration tools to work with, including:
- **Discussions**
- **Whiteboards**
- **Collections of Links or Knowledge**

Ask your community to:
- **Put up articles** with relevant knowledge
- **Create their stakeholder map** on a whiteboard
- **Share relevant experiences**

You can use these tools as you see fit for the Space you are working on. Take a look at the documentation for **[Collaboration Tools](/features/collaboration-tools)** or check out the **[tutorials](/how-to/tutorials)** to discover how you can them. For more suggestions, read more on **[which tool is best](/how-to/best-tool)** for your use case.

### Updates

**Updates** are a powerful way to keep your Community informed and engaged. They allow you to:
- **Broadcast messages** to the community
- Each member (with notifications enabled!) will receive an **email** with your update

As explained earlier, you can send updates via the **Settings > Updates** tab.

### Share

When you have populated the Space, you can start **sharing it** in your network. Pretty much all content on Alkemio is **shareable via direct links**. You can then share the link directly via:
- **Email**
- **LinkedIn**
- **Direct messages** on platforms such as WhatsApp
