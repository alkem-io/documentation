# Updates

Updates are a powerful way to **keep your community informed and engaged**. They allow Space admins and leads to broadcast important messages, ensuring that all members stay up to date with relevant announcements, changes, and opportunities.

Updates appear in the **Updates Block** within a Space.
If there are updates, the Updates block is located on the left side of the Space, below the Events block or below the Subspace/Structure block if no events exist.
Members can see past updates in this section at any time.

Members also receive an email notification when an update is posted (if they have notifications enabled).

This ensures that important messages reach the entire community, both inside and outside the platform.

Updates can also be posted on a Subspace level instead of a Space level. The Updates block will then also be visible in the Subspace instead of the Space and the e-mail notification is sent to the members of the Subspace.

## Posting an Update

Only admins and leads can post updates. To create an update:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Updates from the leads** in your (Sub)Space.
2. Click the text box and type your message.
3. Use the formatting tools to format your text, add links, images, iframes or emoticons.
4. Click "Post Update" to publish the message.

Once posted, the update is immediately visible in the Updates block and sent to members via email notifications.
