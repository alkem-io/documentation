# Innovation Flow
The **Innovation Flow** guides the members through the various phases of the chosen innovation process. You can think of **Design Thinking Flows** or an agreed **innovation process** defined by your organization. Each Subspace has an **Innovation Flow**. You can find the phases of the flow in the top of your Subspace.

- **Current Phase**: In the above picture, you see that the last phase of the innovation flow is dark blue. This means that you are located in that phase.
- **Active Phase**: The last phase in the above example also has a small arrow in front of the name. This means that this is the active Phase of the Innovation Flow. Whenever you navigate to the Subspace, you automatically land on the active phase.
- **Navigation**: Navigate to another phase by clicking on that phase name.

## Managing the Innovation Flow

Admins of the Subspace can manage the Innovation Flow by clicking the button on the right of the flow.

You can manualy create, change and delete steps or choose a template from the (Space) Template Library.

To change a phase in the Innovation Flow, click the three dots in the top right of that phase. This opens a menu in which you can:
- **Set the phase as active phase**: guiding members of the Subspace to the active phase.
- **Edit details**: Edit the title and description of the phase.
- **Delete**: Any Collaboration Tool within the phase will be moved to the first phase.

You can also change the order of the phases. Simply click the title of the phase and drag it to another location.

### Using Templates for the Innovation Flow

- **As an admin of a Subspace:**
  - You can choose a **template** for your Subspace from the templates defined in the Space or from the Template Library.
  - The templates you can choose from are Subspace Templates. You can either only use the Innovation Flow, or also use the Collaboration Tools present in that Subspace Template.
  - When you already have Collaboration Tools in your Subspace and you select another Subspace Template, all Collaboration Tools you already had will be moved to the first phase of the new Innovation Flow.
