# How to Use the Innovation Library?

Innovation is not always easy, and at **Alkemio**, we want to make it easier for everyone to innovate effectively. There is a world of **innovation best practices**, **templates**, and **insights** available. But how do we find them? And more importantly, how can we directly apply them?

The **Innovation Library** on Alkemio makes it easier to share best practices for effective innovation. The Innovation Library is a collection of **whiteboard templates**, **guided innovation flows**, and **exercises** to do with your community. They offer guidance and structure to users of the platform. This results in alignment between all parties and an overview of the steps to be taken or needs to make change. Our Best Practices library is growing daily, with new templates from multiple parties that can share knowledge and expertise.

## What Templates Can I Find in the Library?

You can find an overview of the current set of templates under the **Library**. The library currently includes three types of templates:
- **Whiteboards**
- **Innovation Flows**
- **Posts**

As you can see, the library is divided into two sections:

1. **Templates Bundled into Innovation Packs**
   - **Innovation Packs** are a coherent set of templates based on, for example, a specific theory or theme, best practices shared by an organization, or recommended by a knowledge institute.
   - Clicking on an **Innovation Pack** allows you to see:
     - The templates
     - The facilitating organization
     - A description and references
   - **Anyone** can share their templates in this library to support innovation. If you are interested, please reach out via the **[forum](https://alkem.io/forum)** or by sending an email to **info@alkem.io**.

2. **Browse All Templates**
   - Some templates are part of an Innovation Pack, and some are not.
   - You can **search for keywords** or **filter based on the type of template**.

## How Can I Add the Templates to My Space or Subspace?

The **Innovation Library** shows you all templates that are made available by the Alkemio community. It is also possible to **create your own templates** for your Space or Subspace. Below we will explain how you can **use**, **create**, and **import templates** in the Collaboration Tools.

### Whiteboard and Post Templates

When asking the community for their knowledge and insights, you can either ask for **textual** or **visual** contributions.

- **Whiteboard Templates** can provide inspiration for your creative and collaborative whiteboards, such as:
  - **Stakeholder Map**
  - **Mindmap**
  - **SWOT Analysis**

- **Post Templates** can help you structure the input of your members with a default text or set of questions. For example:
  - Every contribution starts with a **user story**:
    - *As a … I want … so that …*
  - A set of questions:
    1. **Provide a short description of the article**
    2. **Describe why this is relevant for this Subspace**

### Using Templates

  - You can use **whiteboard templates** when you contribute to a **Call for Whiteboards** or **Call for Posts**.
