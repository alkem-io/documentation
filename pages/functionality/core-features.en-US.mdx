# Platform Key Concepts

In this section, you will find the key concepts representing the hierarchy of the Alkemio platform, along with explanations of their functions and utility.

What do we mean by words such as **“Space”**, **“Subspace”**, **“Opportunity”**, and **“Collaboration Tool”**? We explain this below.

## 1. Understanding "Subspace"

### What’s a Subspace?

A **Subspace** is a specific issue within the broader topic and frame of reference introduced by the **Space**. It is a place to explore the issue and everything that can lead towards finding solutions. Subspaces vary from Space to Space and can develop in different ways based on the needs of the community in that specific Space.

Through the creation of a Subspace, you have the chance to shed light on urgent issues—big or small, local, national, or international—that need to be solved. Creating new subspaces allows people to gain more knowledge on the issue and provides the opportunity to meet others with the same concerns or potential solutions to help you out. It can also help you build the right network to bring you closer to finding a solution.

Subspaces can also have their own smaller Subspaces, as even a subproject may need to be split into smaller tasks. Good to keep this in mind!

### What Value Can I Get from a Subspace Community?

Creating a **Subspace** means tackling a general issue or project (**Space**) into specifics and encouraging people to collaborate on subprojects to work out solutions together. **Only together** can we successfully solve these problems.

## 2. Understanding "Space"

### What is a Space?

Picture a **Space** as a virtual environment created for you to engage with something you care about and want to find solutions for. It is a community with a specific frame of reference, under the responsibility of the lead user or organization. The key goal is to gather people and organize them into Subspaces.

### Who Can Create a Space?

A **Space** can be created by members of the platform, together with us, based on a general topic that the creator is interested in. You can start a Space to gather further ideas or simply see it as a place to raise awareness about an issue you believe is urgent and relatable to others. [A demo of an example Space can be found here.](#)

### What Value Can I Get from a Space Community?

Through a **Space**, you can raise attention to a topic of your interest and find more people who share your same interest but have different visions. It is important to create Spaces because they allow topics of interest that concern different people to inspire more ideas. This leads to the creation of different communities around meaningful topics that are relevant to many. Creating a Space means generating knowledge on relevant areas that can then be divided into specific Subspaces—a step that brings us to the next key concept of our platform.

## 3. Understanding Collaboration Tool

### What is a Collaboration Tool?

**Collaboration Tools** are essentially potential questions people may want to raise after starting to work in a **Space** or a **Subspace**. Collaboration Tools should be created to clarify concepts and answer possible questions the community may have. They are a way to involve the community and get feedback on how the overall Space is progressing.

### Why Create Collaboration Tools?

Collaboration Tools help in:
- **Clarifying Concepts**: Making sure everyone has a clear understanding of the project's goals and methodologies.
- **Engaging the Community**: Encouraging active participation and feedback from community members.
- **Tracking Progress**: Monitoring how the Space or Subspace is evolving and addressing any emerging challenges promptly.

### What Can You Do by Creating Collaboration Tools?

By creating Collaboration Tools, you can:
- **Facilitate Communication**: Ensure smooth and effective communication among community members.
- **Enhance Problem-Solving**: Provide structured ways to address and solve issues collaboratively.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Streamline the workflow and make the collaborative process more efficient.
