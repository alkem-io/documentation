# How to Use the Best Practices Library?

Innovation is not always easy, and at **Alkemio**, we want to make it easier for everyone to innovate effectively. There is a world of **innovation best practices**, **templates**, and **insights** available. But how do we find them? And more importantly, how can we directly apply them?

The **Best Practices Library** on Alkemio makes it easier to share best practices for effective innovation. The Best Practices Library is a collection of **whiteboard templates**, **guided innovation flows**, and **exercises** to do with your community. They offer guidance and structure to users of the platform. This results in alignment between all parties and an overview of the steps to be taken or needs to make change. Our Best Practices library is growing daily, with new templates from multiple parties that can share knowledge and expertise.

## What Templates Can I Find in the Library?

You can find an overview of the current set of templates under the **Library**. The library currently includes three types of templates:
- **Whiteboards**
- **Innovation Flows**
- **Posts**

As you can see, the library is divided into two sections:

1. **Templates Bundled into Innovation Packs**
   - **Innovation Packs** are a coherent set of templates based on, for example, a specific theory or theme, best practices shared by an organization, or recommended by a knowledge institute.
   - Clicking on an **Innovation Pack** allows you to see:
     - The templates
     - The facilitating organization
     - A description and references
   - **Anyone** can share their templates in this library to support innovation. If you are interested, please reach out via the **[Forum](#)** or **info@alkem.io**!

2. **Browse All Templates**
   - Some templates are part of an Innovation Pack, and some are not.
   - You can **search for keywords** or **filter based on the type of template**.

## How Can I Add the Templates to My Space or Subspace?

The **Best Practices Library** shows you all templates that are made available by the Alkemio community. It is also possible to **create your own templates** for your Space or Subspace. Below we will explain how you can **use**, **create**, and **import templates** in the Collaboration Tools. More information about these tools can be found on this **[support page](#)**.

### Whiteboard and Post Templates

When asking the community for their knowledge and insights, you can either ask for **textual** or **visual** contributions.

- **Whiteboard Templates** can provide inspiration for your creative and collaborative whiteboards, such as:
  - **Stakeholder Map**
  - **Mindmap**
  - **SWOT Analysis**

- **Post Templates** can help you structure the input of your members with a default text or set of questions. For example:
  - Every contribution starts with a **user story**:
    - *As a … I want … so that …*
  - A set of questions:
    1. **Provide a short description of the article**
    2. **Describe why this is relevant for this Subspace**

### Using Templates

- **As a Member:**
  - You can use **whiteboard templates** when you contribute to a **Call for Whiteboards** or **Call for Posts**.

- **As a Lead:**
  - You can choose templates from the **library of the Space** or the **platform** when adding a new Collaboration Tool, such as:
    - A single whiteboard
    - Call for Whiteboards
    - Call for Posts

### Creating and Importing Templates

- **As a Lead:**
  - You can **create new templates** for the library of the Space.
  - You can either:
    - **Base your template** on one of the templates from the platform library
    - **Start creating your own**
  - To add new templates:
    1. Go to the **Settings** of the Space
    2. Navigate to the **Templates** section

---

## Innovation Flow Templates

The **Innovation Flow** guides the members through the various states of the chosen innovation process. You can think of **Design Thinking Flows** or an agreed **innovation process** defined by your organization. Each Subspace has an **Innovation Flow**. You can find and change them on the **Contribute** tab of your Subspace.

### Using Innovation Flow Templates

- **As a Lead of a Subspace:**
  - You can choose a **template** for your Subspace from the templates defined in the Space.
  - If you want to use other templates, you can **contact the lead of the Space**.

### Creating and Importing Innovation Flow Templates

- **As a Lead of a Space:**
  - You can **add templates** to the Space from the **platform library** or **create a new one yourself**.
  - To do this:
    1. Navigate to the **Settings** of the Space
    2. Go to the **Templates** section
    3. You will find the current set of **Innovation Flow templates** defined in the Space
    4. Click on the **library icon** to search for platform templates or click on **create new** to make your own

## Collaboration Tools

### How to Use Alkemio’s Collaboration Tools?

Discussions with the Alkemio Community have brought forward that users want to contribute in multiple ways: to grow the community, to frame challenges, and to build up shared knowledge. This is now possible! Our selection of collaboration tools offers you the ability to start collaborating directly in the context. Not in a separate document, or Miro board, or spreadsheet, but directly in a Space where you have also gathered the community, the Subspaces, and the Knowledge base.

In this Support page, we will explain what types the platform offers, where you can use them, and how the use of our templates can help you.

### Collaboration Tool Types

When working on a set of Subspaces, effective collaboration tools are essential for sharing information, gathering knowledge, and enabling interaction among community members. Depending on the context, you might need different ways to engage with your community. Here are the current collaboration tools available on the platform:

- **A Post**: Use this tool to initiate discussions, share messages (including guidance videos), or pose questions to the community. Members can respond with comments.
- **A Whiteboard**: Collaborate visually in real time. Multiple participants can add notes, drawings, or other visual elements to a stakeholder map or collectively sketch out the vision for a Subspace.
- **A Collection of Links and Documents**: Curate relevant materials by creating a set of links. This could include articles, blog posts, or guidance documents. Members can contribute by adding links along with brief descriptions.
- **A Call for Posts**: For more structured information gathering, use this tool. As a lead, you can include guiding questions or ask for specific information that members fill in. Responses can be more extensive, including references, tags, and visuals. Other members can also comment on each other’s responses.
- **A Call for Whiteboards**: When seeking multiple visual responses, consider using this tool. The lead can choose a template for members to follow—for instance, asking everyone to draw their vision for a particular challenge.

Feel free to explore these tools and adapt them to your community’s needs! 🚀

{/* ![Collaboration Types](#) */}

### Where Can I Use These Collaboration Tools?

As mentioned before, the **Hosts** are now able to use these tools on any page! This allows them to ask the question where it makes the most sense. Let’s give you some examples:

- **A Post** on the **Dashboard Tab** to ask for comments, suggestions, feedback.
- **A Collection of Links** on the **Dashboard Tab** to share guiding materials to get started in this Space.
- **A Whiteboard** with a stakeholder map on the **Community Tab**, so that the community can contribute with their insights about the current ecosystem.
- **A Post** on the **Community Tab** to ask members to introduce themselves or suggest other people/organizations to invite (see example below).
- **A Call for Posts** on the **Subspaces Tab** where members can submit ideas for creating Subspaces to work in by filling in a few context questions.
- **A Call for Posts** with relevant articles related to the topic on the **Knowledge Base Tab**.

{/* ![Collaboration Example](#) */}

### How Can I Use Templates?

To guide you in creating these collaboration tools to activate your community, the Alkemio Innovation Library offers a set of templates. There is a lot of knowledge, best practices, and templates out there related to innovation. Organizations as well as knowledge institutions often promote these materials via their websites or internal channels, but it is hard to find for the wider community. More importantly, it is hard to directly use them when you want to start collaborating with multiple stakeholders. The platform offers an **Innovation Library** that gathers all these materials and makes them directly available for you to apply in your Space ([more information on this Support Page](#)).

These templates can be used both when you want to open a new callout as well as when you are submitting a new answer or contribution. Note that in principle the leads are able to open a new callout, but they can also choose to allow any member to open a new callout.

There are two relevant types of templates:

#### Post Templates

These templates allow you to choose a set of default text or questions that each contribution must include. Here are a few examples as inspiration:

- **User Story Template**:
  - You want each user to start their answer with a user story. Then you would set the default text for each post: *As a … I want … so that …* Each member can then submit their contribution in a more structured way using this template.
  
- **News Article Submission**:
  - You want users to submit relevant news articles related to a specific Subspace. Then you could state that each contribution must provide a description, why it is relevant for the Subspace, and the source.
  
- **Organization Involvement**:
  - You ask the community to share what organizations should be involved. Then you could let members answer a few questions. For example:
    1. **Why do you think this organization is relevant?**
    2. **How would you like to approach them?**
    3. **Do you need any help?**

When starting a new **Call for Posts**, you can define the default text to structure the answers of your community. When a member submits a new answer, they will be prompted to fill in these questions.

#### Whiteboard Templates

Secondly, you can use our **whiteboard templates** to gather input from the community. You can think of templates for:
- **Stakeholder Maps**
- **Brainstorm Sessions**
- **Innovation Funnels**, etc.

When you start a new **Whiteboard** or a **Call for Whiteboards**, you can directly choose a template from the library of your Space or the platform’s Innovation Library. You can edit them to make them suitable for the particular question. Every time a member wants to submit their contribution, they can use the whiteboard.

### More Settings for the Collaboration Tools

There are several settings that will help you make the most of these collaboration tools. For example, you can:

- **Move Them Up and Down**: Reorder the tools or move them to the bottom or top of the list as well as between the various pages.
- **Share Them**: Share with other people inside and outside of the platform.
- **Expand the Dialog**: See a clearer overview of all contributions.
- **Close Them for Answers**: In the settings, you can decide to turn the switch **‘Accept New Responses’** on or off. Members are still able to see the previous answers and comment on them, but they cannot submit new ones.
- **Create Them in Draft State**: Make them only visible for the admin. When the admin is ready to share it with the community, they can publish it (with the option to notify the community).

### Let’s Get Started!

The current tools are just a glimpse of what they can offer you in the future—think of Polls, Stack Overflow, or other types of integrations. Have fun using them, share your experiences with other users of the platform, and share your feedback!

### 🛠️ Using the Right Tools

You might have noticed that the whiteboard has **2 main menus**:

1. **Top Menu**: For selecting a tool. This menu always has the same items. Feel free to give them a try! 🖌️
2. **Left Menu**: For editing elements. This menu is only visible when you select something on the screen. The items you’ll see depend on the element you selected. For example:
   - **Rectangle**: Change stroke color, background color, fill type, etc.
   - **Text**: Change stroke color, font size, font family, etc. 🎨

#### 📝 Text

Although you can use the “text” tool, we recommend using the “Square” tool instead:

1. Draw a rectangle.
2. Double-click inside it.
3. Start typing. The rectangle wraps your text to the next line when you’ve reached the border. It will automatically grow in the vertical direction when you add more text than fits.

#### ➡️ Arrows

The **arrow tool** can be used ‘standalone’, or you can connect it to one (or two) shape(s). Once you select the arrow tool and hover over a shape, a transparent border will appear. Click here to connect the arrow. By attaching it, the arrow will stick to the shape, even when you move the latter. Arrows (and lines) are straight by default, but it is possible to add a curve. To do so, select the arrow, click on the circle in the center, and drag it up or down to create your curve. 🎯

### 🧰 Other Tools

And there’s more! Don’t hesitate to explore all the tools in the tool menu and the various editing options in the edit menu. You can use different shapes, the pencil tool enables you to draw freehand, you can also upload images, and much more.

### 📚 Library

Alkemio has a **library** with many whiteboards that you can use. Click on the **“Find Template”** button next to the title in the top left of your screen.

### 🌟 Make it Look Nice

#### 📐 Align & Conquer

Messy whiteboard? Try aligning the content. Quickly select all elements by dragging your mouse across them, and scroll down the edit menu in the left pane. There you’ll find the **Align** option, which you can use to align all elements to the left, right, bottom, or top. The two buttons on the right allow you to do something even cooler: to evenly divide the space between elements!

*Please note that the align options only become visible once you’ve selected multiple elements. When elements are already grouped together, you’ll have to ungroup them before you can align.*

**Aligning elements on the go?** Try copying a block by selecting it, and then holding the **Alt-key** when you drag your mouse away. If you also hold the **Shift-key**, the element automatically aligns horizontally or vertically with the origin.

#### 🎨 Using Background Colors & Strokes

- **Tip 1**: Do not use the striped fill behind text.
- **Tip 2**: Make sure that there is enough contrast between the text and the background color.
- **Tip 3**: Be careful with black text on a darker background; aside from the weak contrast, it just doesn’t really look nice.
- **Tip 4**: Make a choice. Use a border or a background color, not both (unless you have a very good reason…)

**↔️ Separating the Border Color from the Text Color**

To make the border color different from the text color, follow these steps:

1. Select the block and change the **stroke color** for the stroke.
2. Double-click inside the block to select the text.
3. Now select the right **stroke color** for the text. If you have the text selected, the border color of the block will not change.
4. Copy this block to use elsewhere so you don’t have to repeat these steps.

### 🏰 Make it Stay Nice

#### 🪢 Grouping Elements

If you have a nice structure in place, you don’t want it to get mixed up when you or someone else changes (e.g.) some text. Select all the elements that you want to group together, right-click on your mouse, and choose **“Group Selection”**. These things now stay together. You can drag them around as a whole or edit content inside the group by clicking on the element a couple of times to get “inside” the group. 🧩

#### 🔒 Locking Elements

When working with various elements on a whiteboard, mistakes are prone to happen. Especially background blocks get moved by accident all. the. time. To prevent this from happening, you can **lock** things that shouldn’t be changed. Right-click the element and select **“Lock”** or use the keyboard shortcut: `CTRL + SHIFT + L`. Unlocking the element also goes very easy: right-click on it and choose **“Unlock”** or `CTRL + SHIFT + L`. Unlocking everything on the whiteboard can be done by right-clicking an empty place on the board and choosing **“Unlock All”**. Locking multiple elements? Consider grouping them first! This way, you can unlock everything at once, instead of having to unlock every item separately when you need to make a couple of changes. 🔒

#### 🔢 Selecting Multiple Objects

To select multiple objects that you want to group, lock, or move, you can do so by holding down the **SHIFT key** while clicking on each object. Another way to select multiple objects quickly is to **drag your mouse** around the objects. Make sure to encircle everything completely because if you miss even a small corner, the object won’t be selected. *Please note that any items that are currently locked will not be included in this selection.* 🖱️

---

### ⌨️ Keyboard Tips

#### 🖱️ Navigation

Press the **space bar** of your keyboard to turn your mouse pointer into a little hand. Click somewhere on the board, hold your mouse pressed, and drag it around. This is a quick way to move to another place on the board if you know where you need to go. If you’re unsure where to go, use the little button next to the zoom controls to get an overview of the entire board. If you hold down the **SHIFT key** while scrolling with your mouse wheel, you can scroll horizontally on the whiteboard instead of vertically.

#### 👯‍♂️ Duplicating Elements

Instead of copying and pasting, you can **duplicate** an element by selecting it, pressing the **ALT key**, and dragging it to the desired location. When duplicating elements while holding **SHIFT**, they will remain aligned horizontally or vertically with the original element.

#### 📏 Quickly Scaling Text

Sometimes the font size is simply too big to nicely fit in your design. When this text is inside a shape and you don’t want to resize the shape, simply select all text in it (`CTRL+A`) and use the keyboard combination above.

#### 🆙 Move Forward/Backward or to Front/Back

Use your **CTRL key** together with the **square bracket keys** to move items forward or backward. You might need to click a couple of times before you get the right result, so often it is faster to move one of the objects completely to the front or back. When adding an object, simply put it to the background by clicking `CTRL+SHIFT+[`. This makes it very simple to later add a background to your board: just put it on top of everything and then use this keyboard shortcut.

#### 👥 Engaging Others

#### 🔒 Lock!

Make sure to **lock all elements** that others shouldn’t be changing. Consider grouping them first, so it’s quicker to unlock parts of your whiteboard when you need to edit something.

#### 📄 Prepare Text Blocks

During interactive sessions, consider adding text blocks with a placeholder, such as `""`, for people to copy and use. You can also use blocks in different colors and assign each color to a different person in advance. This way, you can easily distinguish who added what during the session.

#### 🟪 Use Background Blocks

Consider using blocks to break down multi-step processes or questions into manageable chunks.

## Subspace Setup

### How to Get Started with My Subspaces

The platform allows you to bring the community, the challenges, and knowledge together in one Space. Sometimes you may want to gather your subprojects or other challenges bottom-up after opening your Space; sometimes you already have a set of projects that a (sub-)community is working on. Whether you are working on big or small, on environmental or societal, on global, regional, or local levels, it is all possible. The key is that together with the community you can create alignment: **where are we now and where do we want to go?** Even though we don’t know the solution yet, we avoid duplication of efforts and inefficient use of resources.

### Creating a Subspace

Whether or not you are able to create a new Subspace depends on your role and the choices made by the leads of the Space. They can decide whether any member can open a Subspace or if they want to control the set of Subspaces being worked on.

If you have the right privileges, you can find the **Create Button** on the **Subspaces Page**. You will first be asked some questions to describe the Subspace. Even though you may not know exactly how to solve whatever it is you are working on, you can identify a direction or a few elements that should be taken into account. That is why we ask you, besides the **title** and **challenge statement**, to describe the **current reality** and the **future vision**. You can further add **tags** to make your Subspace easier to find for interested stakeholders. This is just a first pass and can (and probably should) always be adjusted and extended as you continue to work on it.

### Settings of a Subspace

Again, the Subspace has a set of standard settings similar to the Space setup explained on this **[Support Page](#)**: **profile**, **context**, **community**, and **updates**. They allow you to fill in the basic information, visuals, manage the community roles, and send updates.

Furthermore, the **authorization settings** allow you to define who will be the admins and what the members of this Subspace can do. Also, you can choose to make this specific Subspace **private** (non-members are not allowed to read the contents of the Subspace). There might be situations where you want to restrict access to the information in the Subspace due to privacy issues or when you first want to work on the Subspace in a smaller team.

Subspaces can also have, you guessed it, smaller Subspaces. Sometimes you need more than one layer to your work, so you can organize the work of a Subspace into other smaller Subspaces underneath. You can add and manage the identified ideas or directions towards a solution for (part of) the upper Subspace or for the Space. A team of members can then deepen their understanding of the possibility to turn it into action. **Questions to consider:**
- How can it impact the project?
- How can we realize it?
- What resources are needed?

Last but not least, each Subspace has an **Innovation Flow**. This flow can be used, and chosen by the leads, to guide the community through the innovation process. It visualizes the various steps that have to be taken to go from start to end. You can think of **Design Thinking Flows** or an agreed **innovation process** defined by your organization. By moving to the next innovation flow state, you can communicate the process with your members.

### Populating a Subspace

To further populate your Subspace and get your community active, make the **Dashboard** engaging with some updates, interesting recommendations, and references. Also, use the **visuals** and **emoticons** to give the page more color. Then start adding **collaboration tools** on the **Contribute Tab**. Consider:
- What set of questions can your community answer?
- What knowledge and resources do you need?
- Who else should be involved?

### Coordination Subspace

Very often, we see that there are a few leads or core team members driving, managing, and activating the Space. These members want to coordinate with each other—for example, what the next steps of the Space are, what collaboration tools they want to add, capturing meeting notes, and brainstorming boards.

That is why we often see communities that open a **private Coordination Subspace** as a sub-community for this process.
