# How to Use the Best Practices Library?

Innovation is not always easy, and at **Alkemio**, we want to make it easier for everyone to innovate effectively. There is a world of **innovation best practices**, **templates**, and **insights** available. But how do we find them? And more importantly, how can we directly apply them?

The **Best Practices Library** on Alkemio makes it easier to share best practices for effective innovation. The Best Practices Library is a collection of **whiteboard templates**, **guided innovation flows**, and **exercises** to do with your community. They offer guidance and structure to users of the platform. This results in alignment between all parties and an overview of the steps to be taken or needs to make change. Our Best Practices library is growing daily, with new templates from multiple parties that can share knowledge and expertise.

## What Templates Can I Find in the Library?

You can find an overview of the current set of templates under the **Library**. The library currently includes three types of templates:
- **Whiteboards**
- **Innovation Flows**
- **Posts**

As you can see, the library is divided into two sections:

1. **Templates Bundled into Innovation Packs**
   - **Innovation Packs** are a coherent set of templates based on, for example, a specific theory or theme, best practices shared by an organization, or recommended by a knowledge institute.
   - Clicking on an **Innovation Pack** allows you to see:
     - The templates
     - The facilitating organization
     - A description and references
   - **Anyone** can share their templates in this library to support innovation. If you are interested, please reach out via the **[Forum](#)** or **info@alkem.io**!

2. **Browse All Templates**
   - Some templates are part of an Innovation Pack, and some are not.
   - You can **search for keywords** or **filter based on the type of template**.

## How Can I Add the Templates to My Space or Subspace?

The **Best Practices Library** shows you all templates that are made available by the Alkemio community. It is also possible to **create your own templates** for your Space or Subspace. Below we will explain how you can **use**, **create**, and **import templates** in the Collaboration Tools. More information about these tools can be found on this **[support page](#)**.

### Whiteboard and Post Templates

When asking the community for their knowledge and insights, you can either ask for **textual** or **visual** contributions.

- **Whiteboard Templates** can provide inspiration for your creative and collaborative whiteboards, such as:
  - **Stakeholder Map**
  - **Mindmap**
  - **SWOT Analysis**

- **Post Templates** can help you structure the input of your members with a default text or set of questions. For example:
  - Every contribution starts with a **user story**:
    - *As a … I want … so that …*
  - A set of questions:
    1. **Provide a short description of the article**
    2. **Describe why this is relevant for this Subspace**

### Using Templates

- **As a Member:**
  - You can use **whiteboard templates** when you contribute to a **Call for Whiteboards** or **Call for Posts**.

## Collaboration Tools

### How to Use Alkemio’s Collaboration Tools?

Discussions with the Alkemio Community have brought forward that users want to contribute in multiple ways: to grow the community, to frame challenges, and to build up shared knowledge. This is now possible! Our selection of collaboration tools offers you the ability to start collaborating directly in the context. Not in a separate document, or Miro board, or spreadsheet, but directly in a Space where you have also gathered the community, the Subspaces, and the Knowledge base.

In this Support page, we will explain what types the platform offers, where you can use them, and how the use of our templates can help you.

### Collaboration Tool Types

When working on a set of Subspaces, effective collaboration tools are essential for sharing information, gathering knowledge, and enabling interaction among community members. Depending on the context, you might need different ways to engage with your community. Here are the current collaboration tools available on the platform:

- **A Post**: Use this tool to initiate discussions, share messages (including guidance videos), or pose questions to the community. Members can respond with comments.
- **A Whiteboard**: Collaborate visually in real time. Multiple participants can add notes, drawings, or other visual elements to a stakeholder map or collectively sketch out the vision for a Subspace.
- **A Collection of Links and Documents**: Curate relevant materials by creating a set of links. This could include articles, blog posts, or guidance documents. Members can contribute by adding links along with brief descriptions.
- **A Call for Posts**: For more structured information gathering, use this tool. As a lead, you can include guiding questions or ask for specific information that members fill in. Responses can be more extensive, including references, tags, and visuals. Other members can also comment on each other’s responses.
- **A Call for Whiteboards**: When seeking multiple visual responses, consider using this tool. The lead can choose a template for members to follow—for instance, asking everyone to draw their vision for a particular challenge.

Feel free to explore these tools and adapt them to your community’s needs! 🚀

### Where Can I Use These Collaboration Tools?

As mentioned before, the **Hosts** are now able to use these tools on any page! This allows them to ask the question where it makes the most sense. Let’s give you some examples:

- **A Post** on the **Dashboard Tab** to ask for comments, suggestions, feedback.
- **A Collection of Links** on the **Dashboard Tab** to share guiding materials to get started in this Space.
- **A Whiteboard** with a stakeholder map on the **Community Tab**, so that the community can contribute with their insights about the current ecosystem.
- **A Post** on the **Community Tab** to ask members to introduce themselves or suggest other people/organizations to invite (see example below).
- **A Call for Posts** on the **Subspaces Tab** where members can submit ideas for creating Subspaces to work in by filling in a few context questions.
- **A Call for Posts** with relevant articles related to the topic on the **Knowledge Base Tab**.

{/* ![Collaboration Example](#) */}

### How Can I Use Templates?

To guide you in creating these collaboration tools to activate your community, the Alkemio Innovation Library offers a set of templates. There is a lot of knowledge, best practices, and templates out there related to innovation. Organizations as well as knowledge institutions often promote these materials via their websites or internal channels, but it is hard to find for the wider community. More importantly, it is hard to directly use them when you want to start collaborating with multiple stakeholders. The platform offers an **Innovation Library** that gathers all these materials and makes them directly available for you to apply in your Space ([more information on this Support Page](#)).

These templates can be used both when you want to open a new callout as well as when you are submitting a new answer or contribution. Note that in principle the leads are able to open a new callout, but they can also choose to allow any member to open a new callout.

There are two relevant types of templates:

#### Post Templates

These templates allow you to choose a set of default text or questions that each contribution must include. Here are a few examples as inspiration:

- **User Story Template**:
  - You want each user to start their answer with a user story. Then you would set the default text for each post: *As a … I want … so that …* Each member can then submit their contribution in a more structured way using this template.
  
- **News Article Submission**:
  - You want users to submit relevant news articles related to a specific Subspace. Then you could state that each contribution must provide a description, why it is relevant for the Subspace, and the source.
  
- **Organization Involvement**:
  - You ask the community to share what organizations should be involved. Then you could let members answer a few questions. For example:
    1. **Why do you think this organization is relevant?**
    2. **How would you like to approach them?**
    3. **Do you need any help?**

When starting a new **Call for Posts**, you can define the default text to structure the answers of your community. When a member submits a new answer, they will be prompted to fill in these questions.

#### Whiteboard Templates

Secondly, you can use our **whiteboard templates** to gather input from the community. You can think of templates for:
- **Stakeholder Maps**
- **Brainstorm Sessions**
- **Innovation Funnels**, etc.

When you start a new **Whiteboard** or a **Call for Whiteboards**, you can directly choose a template from the library of your Space or the platform’s Innovation Library. You can edit them to make them suitable for the particular question. Every time a member wants to submit their contribution, they can use the whiteboard.

### More Settings for the Collaboration Tools

There are several settings that will help you make the most of these collaboration tools. For example, you can:

- **Move Them Up and Down**: Reorder the tools or move them to the bottom or top of the list as well as between the various pages.
- **Share Them**: Share with other people inside and outside of the platform.
- **Expand the Dialog**: See a clearer overview of all contributions.
- **Close Them for Answers**: In the settings, you can decide to turn the switch **‘Accept New Responses’** on or off. Members are still able to see the previous answers and comment on them, but they cannot submit new ones.
- **Create Them in Draft State**: Make them only visible for the admin. When the admin is ready to share it with the community, they can publish it (with the option to notify the community).

### Let’s Get Started!

The current tools are just a glimpse of what they can offer you in the future—think of Polls, Stack Overflow, or other types of integrations. Have fun using them, share your experiences with other users of the platform, and share your feedback!

### 🛠️ Using the Right Tools

You might have noticed that the whiteboard has **2 main menus**:

1. **Top Menu**: For selecting a tool. This menu always has the same items. Feel free to give them a try! 🖌️
2. **Left Menu**: For editing elements. This menu is only visible when you select something on the screen. The items you’ll see depend on the element you selected. For example:
   - **Rectangle**: Change stroke color, background color, fill type, etc.
   - **Text**: Change stroke color, font size, font family, etc. 🎨

#### 📝 Text

Although you can use the “text” tool, we recommend using the “Square” tool instead:

1. Draw a rectangle.
2. Double-click inside it.
3. Start typing. The rectangle wraps your text to the next line when you’ve reached the border. It will automatically grow in the vertical direction when you add more text than fits.

#### ➡️ Arrows

The **arrow tool** can be used ‘standalone’, or you can connect it to one (or two) shape(s). Once you select the arrow tool and hover over a shape, a transparent border will appear. Click here to connect the arrow. By attaching it, the arrow will stick to the shape, even when you move the latter. Arrows (and lines) are straight by default, but it is possible to add a curve. To do so, select the arrow, click on the circle in the center, and drag it up or down to create your curve. 🎯

### 🧰 Other Tools

And there’s more! Don’t hesitate to explore all the tools in the tool menu and the various editing options in the edit menu. You can use different shapes, the pencil tool enables you to draw freehand, you can also upload images, and much more.

### 📚 Library

Alkemio has a **library** with many whiteboards that you can use. Click on the **“Find Template”** button next to the title in the top left of your screen.

### 🌟 Make it Look Nice

#### 📐 Align & Conquer

Messy whiteboard? Try aligning the content. Quickly select all elements by dragging your mouse across them, and scroll down the edit menu in the left pane. There you’ll find the **Align** option, which you can use to align all elements to the left, right, bottom, or top. The two buttons on the right allow you to do something even cooler: to evenly divide the space between elements!

*Please note that the align options only become visible once you’ve selected multiple elements. When elements are already grouped together, you’ll have to ungroup them before you can align.*

**Aligning elements on the go?** Try copying a block by selecting it, and then holding the **Alt-key** when you drag your mouse away. If you also hold the **Shift-key**, the element automatically aligns horizontally or vertically with the origin.

#### 🎨 Using Background Colors & Strokes

- **Tip 1**: Do not use the striped fill behind text.
