# Community Management

Congratulations on starting to build your online community! Finding ways to make your community engaged and active can be difficult. This page includes tips and tricks to get to know the platform, its structure and concepts, how to populate your Space, and how the functionalities on Alkemio can keep your community active. **But first, you are not alone!** So join our **[Communities for Change Space](#)**, where you can share insights and experiences from other leads as well as tips and tricks from the Alkemio team.

## 1. Getting to Know the Alkemio Structure

While you may be managing your projects using Excel spreadsheets, Trello to manage your tasks, Miro to capture your brainstorm sessions, or LinkedIn to find relevant people to connect with, the **Alkemio platform** combines it all—**all centered around the urgent societal and environmental challenges of today**.

As with any tooling, understanding the platform will help you get the most out of it. A good place to start is reading about the **[platform structure and its key concepts](#)** on this support page. Are you interested in reading more about the **mission and vision of the foundation** behind the platform? Have a look at our **[Manifesto](#)**.

## 2. Setting Up Your Space

After the Alkemio team has set up the first **Demo Space** for you, there are some general decisions to make about the setup of your Space. If you navigate to the settings of the Space, you will find them under the **Settings** sub-section.

Here you can decide on:
- **Visibility** of your Space (public or private)
- **Who can join** your Space (any user, only invited users, or users associated with certain organizations)
- **Permissions** for Space members (what they can do)
- **Application Form Questions** (select a few questions for the application form)

Now let’s have a look at the other sub-sections: **Profile**, **Context**, **Community**, **Updates**, **Subspaces**, **Templates**, and **Storage**.

#### Space Profile

To make your Space visually attractive for new members, it is important to choose an engaging **tagline** as well as **visuals**. They will be visible on the home page for all visitors of the platform as well as the dashboard page of your Space.

Also, you can add additional **tags** to summarize the content and make the Space easier to find. Finally, you can add **references** (links and documents) for your community, such as:
- Your website or the facilitating organization
- An article or report related to this Space
- An introduction video, etc.

#### Context

For yourself and the members of your community, it is essential to understand the **context** of the Space. We have divided this into four key sections:
- **Vision**
- **Background**
- **Impact**
- **Who Should Be Involved**

The provided questions will guide you through filling in all these sections. Note that you can also use text styles such as **bold**, **headings**, etc., or add **images** to make it more visually attractive and understandable. Start with a first pass; it is always adjustable later.

#### Community

Here you can manage:
- **Pending Applications and Invitations**
- **Community Roles** of members and leading users and organizations

There are four different types of community roles for users and organizations:
1. **Members**: Contribute to the Space with insights and experiences.
2. **Leads**: Visible as and responsible for driving the activity in this Space.
3. **Admins**: Not visible as leads but can manage the content of the Space in the backend.
4. **Host**: Responsible for the content of the Space, such as moderating undesired content or discussions. This role is visible on the profile of the Space and can be managed by the Alkemio Team.

#### Updates, Subspaces, and Storage

These sections are straightforward as they allow you to:
- **Post Updates**
- **Manage Subspaces**
- **Access Documents** uploaded in your Space

If you already have a few ideas in mind regarding Subspaces for this community, you can directly add them under the **Subspaces** tab. Our **context questions** will guide you through the process of framing your Subspace. Note that for Subspaces, you can follow similar steps as the ones for the Space to further populate it.

#### Templates

This section allows you to decide what **templates** you want to make available for the community. These templates can be used by members when:
- Working with the collaboration tools
- Starting a new Subspace

You can find more information on how to **[use, create, and import templates](#)** on this support page.

## 3. How to Engage Your Community?

Besides some descriptive information, it is key to engage and guide your community when they land on the platform. **Three key functionalities** that can help you with this are the following:

### Events

Bringing your community together in **on- or offline events** or meet-ups is key to activating them. Here you can add the upcoming events with:
- **Description**
- **Time and Location**
- **Link** to a meeting or sign-up page

### Recommendations

When you start working in your Space, there is a default section for **Recommendations by the Host**. This section can be used to guide your community to the most relevant content of the Space. Especially when they enter the Space for the first time, they want to know where to go. This collection of links can, for example, include:
- A **‘Getting Started in this Space’** document
- An **explainer video**
- **Questions** that most urgently need their action
- A **sign-up link** for the next community event

Of course, it is always possible to delete the section if you don’t want to use it.

### Collaboration Tools

Instead of only bringing the community together and starting discussions, the platform allows you to **really start collaborating together**. The platform offers a set of collaboration tools to work with, including:
- **Discussions**
- **Whiteboards**
- **Collections of Links or Knowledge**

Ask your community to:
- **Put up articles** with relevant knowledge
- **Create their stakeholder map** on a whiteboard
- **Share relevant experiences**

You are able to use these tools as you see fit for the Space you are working on. Have a look at this **[support page](#)** to discover how you can use these Collaboration Tools.

### Updates

**Updates** are a powerful way to keep your Community informed and engaged. They allow you to:
- **Broadcast messages** to the community
- Each member (with notifications enabled!) will receive an **email** with your update

As explained earlier, you can send updates via the **Settings > Updates** tab.

### Share

When you have populated the Space, you can start **sharing it** in your network. Pretty much all content on Alkemio is **shareable via direct links**. You can then share the link directly via:
- **Email**
- **LinkedIn**
- **Direct messages** on platforms such as WhatsApp
