# Understanding the Space

## What is a Space?

A **Space** is a virtual environment for collaboration. It is a community with a specific frame of reference, under the responsibility of the lead user or organization. Gather your community, create **Subspaces** for people to collaborate in, and work towards your goals. [Check out our Welcome Space as an example](#https://alkem.io/welcome-space/dashboard).

### Who Can Create a Space?

A **Space** can be created by a member of the platform with the rights to do so, or with the help of the Alkemio team. 

### What Value Can I Get from a Space Community?

Through a **Space**, you can raise attention to a topic of your interest and find more people who share your same interest but have different visions. It is important to create Spaces because they allow topics of interest that concern different people to inspire more ideas. This leads to the creation of different communities around meaningful topics that are relevant to many. Creating a Space means generating knowledge on relevant areas that can then be divided into specific Subspacesâ€”a step that brings us to the next key concept of our platform.
