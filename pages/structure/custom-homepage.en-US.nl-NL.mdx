# Custom Homepage Overview

Custom homepages in Alkemio are tailored landing pages designed for organizations to showcase their work and provide centralized access to multiple spaces they lead. These homepages act as gateways to related projects and spaces, serving specific organizational needs. They are distinct from the universal Alkemio homepage and are hosted on unique URLs. For example, **[inspiration.alkem.io](https://inspiration.alkem.io/home)** is Alkemio's own custom homepage for showcasing demo spaces to inspire platform users.

## Why Create a Custom Homepage?

Custom homepages provide organizations with the flexibility to:

- Showcase their work in a **branded and curated environment**.
- Highlight **specific projects, use cases, or initiatives**.
- Simplify navigation across their spaces for improved user engagement.
- Act as an **entry point for collaboration** tailored to their goals.

By hosting custom homepages on unique URLs (e.g., _inspiration.alkem.io_), organizations can create their own landing page(s) that align with their mission and serve as hub for their content.
