## Understanding the Subspace

### What’s a Subspace?

A **Subspace** is a specific issue within the broader topic and frame of reference introduced by the **Space**. It is a place to explore the issue and everything that can lead towards finding solutions. Subspaces vary from Space to Space and can develop in different ways based on the needs of the community in that specific Space.

Through the creation of a Subspace, you have the chance to shed light on urgent issues—big or small, local, national, or international—that need to be solved. Creating new subspaces allows people to gain more knowledge on the issue and provides the opportunity to meet others with the same concerns or potential solutions to help you out. It can also help you build the right network to bring you closer to finding a solution.

Subspaces can also have their own smaller Subspaces, as even a subproject may need to be split into smaller tasks. Good to keep this in mind!

### What Value Can I Get from a Subspace Community?

Creating a **Subspace** means tackling a general issue or project (**Space**) into specifics and encouraging people to collaborate on subprojects to work out solutions together. **Only together** can we successfully solve these problems.
