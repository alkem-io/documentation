# Custom Homepage Overview

Custom homepages in Alkemio are tailored landing pages designed for organizations to showcase their work and provide centralized access to multiple spaces they lead. These homepages act as gateways to related projects and spaces, serving specific organizational needs. They are distinct from the universal Alkemio homepage and are hosted on unique URLs. For example, **[inspiration.alkem.io](https://inspiration.alkem.io/home)** is Alkemio's own custom homepage for showcasing demo spaces to inspire platform users.

## Purpose of Custom Homepages

- Provide a **central hub** for spaces managed by an organization.

### What's in a Custom Homepage?

Let's take the example of **[inspiration.alkem.io](https://inspiration.alkem.io/home)** and break down what a custom page can contain.

#### Header Section

- **Title**: *"Use Case Inspiration"*, clearly stating the page's focus.
- **Subtitle**: *"Demo spaces for inspiration on the usage of Alkemio,"* providing additional context.

#### Description Panel

A concise message explains the page’s purpose:

> *"Spaces that are populated to get some idea for what kind of projects you could use Alkemio for, and how you can set up spaces for your work."*

#### Showcased Spaces

## Why Create a Custom Homepage?

Custom homepages provide organizations with the flexibility to:
- Showcase their work in a **branded and curated environment**.
- Highlight **specific projects, use cases, or initiatives**.
- Simplify navigation across their spaces for improved user engagement.
- Act as an **entry point for collaboration** tailored to their goals.

By hosting custom homepages on unique URLs (e.g., *inspiration.alkem.io*), organizations can create their own landing page(s) that align with their mission and serve as hub for their content.
